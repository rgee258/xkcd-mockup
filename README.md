# xkcd Mockup

This repository contains a mockup of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/). The particular comic that is featured in this mockup is the comic on [UI vs UX](https://xkcd.com/2141/).

This page uses the [small framework](https://github.com/rgee258/12-grid-css) I created for formatting the page into a 12 column based grid. The margins of the columns were changed from 10px to 2px per side. 

The top two areas are arranged using colunms of size 2 and 6, with the larger ones appropriately sized at 8.

This was just a simple a project to make use of the framework I created but I also learned about the interesting **map** tag to be used with images in your html. So thanks xkcd, your comics are great and I learned an interesting way to add **a** tags to images.

The Lucida Sans font used is courtesy of [wfonts](https://www.wfonts.com/).
